# React and Storybook sample project

This is a simple example project with React and Storybook, following intro course [here](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-set-up-storybook-for-react-from-scratch), and the instructor's repo [here](https://github.com/sw-yx/react-typescript-storybook-starter) (shhhh, they locks the code for members only, but I googled it out).

Took me some time to fix dependency version problems, even thought of dropping it. But here it is, a working project, finally.

And, if you are reading this in a future time, this project works as of April, 2019. Good luck in the future :)
